## Summary

The Quilt Kotlin Team will be responsible for developing and maintaining the
Quilt Kotlin Libraries (Henceforth QKL). QKL is set of libraries, built off of
QSL, intended for use in the Kotlin programming language.


## Motivation

Giving developers an official way to use Kotlin on Quilt, as well as providing
wrappers for QSL and the Minecraft codebase for easier use in Kotlin.


## Explanation

The Quilt Kotlin Team will be responsible for reviewing pull requests,
designating new modules, developing, and maintaining QKL. It falls under RFC
0018 (Technical Teams), and will follow the same standards definedin the RFC


## Drawbacks

TBD


## Prior Art

Fabric Language Kotlin is a library for using Kotlin on the Fabirc platform.
It only provides the Kotlin stdlib, and Kotlinx libraries, while QKL will also
provide wrappers for QSL and the Minecraft codebase


## Unresolved Questions

- Should this be a subdivision of QSL?
- Would we provide wrappers for other libraries seperate from QSL?
- What modules should be in QKL?
